                "content": "So, the November Meme calendar of Malaysia honoured an entrepreneur couple, who got entangled in the mismanagement of nearly 50 million Ringgit in investment fund. The authorities are not after the money trail. Combing thru a fine-tooth comb, the spotlight is now on two Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) for failing (or lacking) to perform the necessary due diligence on their startup. The general public can’t help but point their fingers at the “big C”. Corruption, defined as the abuse of power for personal gain, remains a pervasive issue in Malaysia. Its far-reaching impacts spanning across economic, political, and social systems - destabilize institutions, distort markets, and erode public trust. Due diligence, on the other hand, is a rigorous process of investigation and analysis, aimed at ensuring transparency, assessing risks, and verifying information before entering into business or financial relationships. At its core, due diligence serves to prevent fraud, mitigate risks, and uphold compliance with legal, ethical, and regulatory standards. The relationship between corruption and due diligence is vital and complex, because due diligence can serve as a crucial tool for identifying, mitigating, and ultimately preventing corrupt practices. This article explores how due diligence interacts with corruption, why it is a key defence against corrupt activities, and how businesses and organizations can strengthen their practices to minimize exposure to corruption risks."

                "content": "One of the primary roles of due diligence in the context of corruption is as a proactive shield. Corruption often thrives in environments where there is a lack of transparency, weak governance structures, or insufficient monitoring of business practices. This is particularly true in cross-border transactions, where cultural norms, differing regulatory environments, and legal complexities can make it easier for corrupt practices to slip through the cracks. In Malaysia, we have stooped to a level that a police road block is just a ‘cari makan’ and not serving the true purpose. Political appointees are just Ministers’ cronies to stay in power. The list goes on. By performing comprehensive due diligence, companies and organizations can: - Identify Risk Factors: A thorough due diligence process helps identify potential corruption risks in a business or investment venture. For example, examining the ownership structures of a company or the backgrounds of key personnel can highlight connections to politically exposed persons (PEPs), known corrupt officials, or entities with histories of bribery or fraud. - Verify Legitimacy: Due diligence helps ensure that the entities or individuals you are dealing with are legitimate, compliant with relevant anti-corruption laws, and free from any criminal backgrounds that could expose your business to liability. This is especially important when entering unfamiliar or high-risk jurisdictions where corruption is endemic. - Ensure Compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws: Venovox had a full Seminar on ABAC. Do browse of publication list for the article and video. Many countries have strict anti-corruption regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or the UK Bribery Act. Through due diligence, companies can assess whether their partners, suppliers, or third-party agents are complying with these laws. Failure to conduct proper due diligence can expose organizations to fines, reputational damage, and other legal consequences."

                "content": "Due diligence is not a one-size-fits-all process; it requires a tailored approach based on the specific risks and challenges posed by a given transaction or partnership. In the context of corruption, several types of due diligence can be particularly useful: - Financial Due Diligence: Examining the financial health of a company can reveal irregularities, such as suspicious payments or unexplained transactions that could be indicative of corrupt practices. This includes reviewing financial statements, transaction records, and tax filings to ensure all business activities are legitimate and properly documented. - Legal Due Diligence: This process involves reviewing the legal standing of a company or individual, such as checking for any history of litigation related to corruption or fraud. It also includes assessing the legal compliance of partners and suppliers with anti-corruption laws and regulations. - Background Checks: A key component of due diligence is conducting background checks on potential business partners, executives, and third-party intermediaries. This may involve investigating their history, including prior criminal convictions, associations with corrupt individuals or entities, and involvement in any past corruption scandals. 1000+ Clients of Venovox can’t be wrong in engaging our services for their new hires. Stay in touch with Kelly at 012 800 8888 or kelly@venovox.com for a tailor-made program to meet your hiring need. - Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policies: A due diligence review should include an assessment of a company's internal anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies. This ensures that the company has appropriate mechanisms in place to prevent, detect, and respond to corrupt behaviour within its operations. - Third-Party Risk Assessment: Companies often rely on intermediaries, agents, or contractors to conduct business. Due diligence helps assess the risk posed by third parties by evaluating their reputation, compliance with laws, and potential connections to corrupt activities.",

Some of the risks associated with neglecting due diligence in the fight against corruption include: - Legal and Regulatory Penalties: Non-compliance with anti-corruption regulations can result in hefty fines, sanctions, and even imprisonment for key personnel. This is especially pertinent for multinational corporations operating across jurisdictions with differing corruption laws. - Reputational Damage: Corruption scandals can seriously damage an organization’s reputation, leading to the loss of customers, investors, and business partners. A tarnished reputation can take years to rebuild and may even result in the permanent loss of trust within an industry. - Financial Losses: Engaging with corrupt parties can lead to financial losses from fraud, embezzlement, or contract cancellation. Additionally, the costs associated with regulatory investigations, legal proceedings, and settlements can drain corporate resources. - Lost Business Opportunities: If a company is implicated in corrupt activities, it may be excluded from future business opportunities, partnerships, or government contracts. This can result in long-term economic damage and limited growth prospects."

Tools such as artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, and blockchain technology have made it easier to assess corruption risks in real-time, analyse large sets of financial and legal data, and track the flow of funds across complex networks. Companies can now use these technologies to identify unusual patterns or transactions that could signal corrupt behaviour, allowing them to act swiftly to mitigate risks. Venovox have established our own platform codenamed VOSS. Feel free to explore at www.venovox.com. For example, AI can be used to scan and cross-reference massive amounts of public records, such as news articles, court filings, and government sanctions lists, to identify potential red flags. Blockchain, with its transparency and immutability, can be used to track financial transactions and ensure that there is no manipulation or illicit activity in the movement of funds. With cross border banking and digital banks mushrooming, money trail is no longer limited to physical borders alone. Money today in Malaysia can resurface in Estonia by tomorrow.",

This not only helps protect against corrupt activities but also positions organizations as responsible corporate citizens committed to sustainable and ethical business practices. In a world where the cost of corruption is high, due diligence offers an essential safeguard for both businesses and society at large."

The escalating expectations of customers and decreased tolerance for misconduct are creating a delicate operating environment in relation to reputation risk, making it essential for businesses to adapt effectively. Reputational risk refers to anything that can damage the way a company is perceived. It includes threats, whether true or not, that could harm the name, goodwill, or credibility of a business, ultimately impacting its revenue. Quantifying reputational risk is challenging as it comes in various forms, whether as a result of the company's own actions or through associations with third-party businesses.

Therefore, it is imperative for human resources (HR) staff to actively seek out executives with a strong reputation to bolster the public image of the organization. The professional conduct of these leaders is instrumental in helping companies establish and maintain a positive image. Additionally, it's important to recognize that suppliers or partners also carry a potential reputational risk for the organization. The reputation of a supplier can significantly impact your company's overall reputation and subsequently affect its financial standing. Collaborating with third-party suppliers, vendors, and partners from diverse geographic locations introduces various risks. Some risks, such as data breaches or bankruptcies, are readily apparent, while others, such as negative press or questionable business practices, may not be immediately evident. Since a supplier’s reputation can quickly become synonymous with your company’s reputation, it is crucial to proactively monitor third parties for any potential reputational risks that could have a direct impact on the company’s financial performance."

Regular evaluations of supply chain partners against industry benchmarks and regulations will reveal discrepancies, thereby illuminating previously unnoticed risks. Risk management extends beyond just your suppliers. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct a thorough pre-screening of all employees before their onboarding. Implementing a pre-employment background check and reference verification is essential to confirm the candidate's qualifications and identify any potential concerns. However, the risk an individual may pose to the organization does not cease once they are hired. Engaging in a reputable background screening service ensures that the evaluation is unbiased and tailored to the specific industry and position. This allows the hiring organization to address any inconsistencies or issues that arise during the screening process with the candidate, providing an opportunity for clarification. While serious discrepancies may lead to disqualification, the insights gained from the background check are invaluable in making informed hiring decisions.",

Conducting student loan screening (with consent from employees) during pre-employment will ease the employees’ phobias and foster an environment where employees feel comfortable discussing their financial commitments without fear of judgment. Pre-screening on student loan will also ensure that any discussions about financial matters are kept confidential to protect employees’ privacy and that the employer provides a supportive environment that cultivate a workplace culture that values and supports employees’ well-being, including their financial health. A simple screening today means employers can help employees manage their PTPTN commitments more effectively, reduce financial stress, and contribute to a more productive and engaged workforce."

In many industries, it’s common for jobs to be filled through referrals or word-of-mouth recommendations. A strong network serves as a resource for learning and staying updated on industry trends. Connecting with experts or peers allows you to gain new perspectives and insights, keeping you informed about innovations, best practices, and emerging technologies that could impact your career or business. Networking can play a crucial role in personal career growth. Mentors, colleagues, and industry leaders in your network can provide advice, guidance, and support, helping you make informed decisions at critical points in your career. Building relationships with people who have already navigated similar paths can significantly shorten your learning curve. Consistently showing up, offering help, and sharing your expertise with others in your network helps to build trust and establish your credibility. Over time, people come to know you as a reliable and resourceful person, making them more likely to turn to you for advice, partnerships, or recommendations. For entrepreneurs, networking is vital for expanding business opportunities. Forming connections with investors, potential clients, or collaborators can help grow your business and increase its visibility. Strong networks can also provide critical support in times of uncertainty or crisis, making your business more resilient.",

Online platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and industry-specific forums are powerful tools for expanding your network beyond your immediate geographic area. These platforms provide opportunities to connect with professionals globally, join discussions, and stay updated on industry news. Industry conferences, seminars, and local meetups are great opportunities to meet people face-to-face. Engaging in conversations during these events can help solidify relationships and make a lasting impression. Virtual events have also become more popular and accessible, enabling people to network remotely. One of the best ways to establish strong connections is by offering value to others first.

Under this Act, employees who believe they have been unfairly dismissed may lodge a complaint with the Director General of Industrial Relations (DGIR) within 60 days from the date of dismissal. If the dispute is unresolved, it may be referred to the Industrial Court for adjudication. A recent case at the Industrial Court of Malaysia, Mohd Fauzi bin Mohd Shariff vs. Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, highlights the importance of proper dismissal procedures. The claimant, a Branch Manager, was dismissed for allegedly sleeping at work. However, the court ruled that the dismissal was unreasonable and unjust, considering his good leadership and the branch’s performance under his management. The court awarded the claimant RM240,384 in compensation for wrongful dismissal. This case serves as a crucial reminder for employers that unjust dismissal can lead to costly legal disputes.",
